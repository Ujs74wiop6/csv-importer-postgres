Have you ever faced problems or difficulties importing a CSV database into Postgres SQL?

Your problems are over! The ``` csv-impoter-postgres ``` project was developed primarily to solve this problem.

Using Python and a graphical interface called Tkinter, you simply run the program on your machine using the command ``` python3 importer.py ``` and then fill in your PostgreSQL information, such as the database name (remember that the CSV file will be converted to a table, so it needs to be within a database*),
username, database password, the name of the table that will represent the database, and of course, locate the CSV file you want to import!
